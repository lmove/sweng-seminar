### Software Ecosystems: A Socio-technical Perspective
This talk will describe recent and ongoing research in the Human Aspects of Software Engineering Lab at the University of Auckland, New Zealand. Most modern software systems depend on other software components.
Dependencies between software projects create large, intertwined networks of software projects.
Within these software ecosystems, software engineers need to coordinate and work together to create software products that meet their users needs. 
I will talk about some of the socio-technical challenges and the need for better understanding of social aspects to create inclusive software products.

**Time:** 11:15-12:00
